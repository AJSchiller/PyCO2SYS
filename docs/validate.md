# Should you trust PyCO2SYS?

There are no "certified" results of marine carbonate system calculations against which software like PyCO2SYS can be unambiguously validated.  Even so, we can evaluate its performance by testing its internal consistency, and by comparing its outputs with those from other programs.

## Internal consistency

### Round robin

PyCO2SYS can solve the marine carbonate system from any valid pair of total alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, pH, partial pressure or fugacity or molinity of aqueous CO<sub>2</sub>, bicarbonate ion molinity, and carbonate ion molinity.  In a "round robin" test, we solve all of these core variables from one given pair, and then
